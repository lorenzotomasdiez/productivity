## Goal Framework by Field
**Recommended approach per life area:**

- **Health**: Habit-based (daily workouts, meal logging) + numeric (weight targets, workout minutes)
- **Finance**: Numeric targets (savings goals, investment returns) + habit tracking (daily expense logging)
- **Learning**: Mixed (books completed + daily reading streaks, courses finished + study hours)
- **Work/Studies**: Project-based milestones + daily productivity habits
- **Personal Growth**: Habit-based with milestone celebrations

## Personal Assistant Features
- **Adaptive Learning**: AI learns user patterns, preferences, and optimal timing
- **Proactive Intelligence**: Suggestions, reminders, and insights delivered contextually
- **Multi-modal Interaction**: Voice, text, quick actions, and smart notifications

## Psychological Engagement System
- **Habit Formation**: Leverage dopamine loops, variable reward schedules
- **Progress Visualization**: Streaks, achievements, visual progress indicators
- **Micro-Rewards**: Daily wins, completion celebrations, surprise bonuses
- **Life Solver Approach**: Frame as solving life puzzles rather than tracking tasks
- **Gamification Elements**: Points, levels, challenges (subtle, not childish)

## AI Interaction System
- **Primary Interface**: Chat-based interaction with "Jarvis" AI Assistant
- **Full Data Access**: Jarvis has complete access to all app data for comprehensive assistance
- **Conversational Intelligence**: Natural language queries about any life aspect or data point

## Automated Research Engine
- **Research Categories**: User-defined topics (investments, learning, Twitter content, etc.)
- **Custom Research Prompts**: Detailed instructions per category with specific parameters
- **Scheduled Automation**: Configurable intervals (daily, weekly, custom) per research category
- **Research Pipeline**:
  1. AI conducts research based on prompts
  2. Generates structured reports/content
  3. User review: Keep, discard, or modify
  4. Approved content integrated into relevant life areas
- **Content Types**: Market analysis, learning materials, social media content, trend reports

## Data Architecture & Privacy
- **Trusted AI Integration**: Complete data transparency for Jarvis assistant
- **Comprehensive Context**: All life areas accessible for cross-domain insights
- **Secure Cloud Processing**: Trusted AI providers for advanced capabilities
- **Data Sovereignty**: User owns all data with export capabilities

## MVP Feature Priority

✅ **Core Features Specified**: Dashboard, Jarvis, automation, research
✅ **Technical Architecture**: Native apps + API backend
✅ **User Experience**: Chat-first, research-automated, psychologically engaging
✅ **Scope Clarity**: Personal use MVP with market potential

## Development Approach: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### TDD Philosophy for Jarvis
This project will be built using strict Test-Driven Development principles:

1. **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**: Every feature starts with a failing test
2. **Test First**: No production code written without a corresponding test
3. **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications
4. **Quality Assurance**: 85%+ code coverage target for production release

### Testing Strategy Overview
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Business logic, models, services
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: API endpoints, database operations, external services
- **End-to-End Tests (10%)**: Complete user workflows, UI automation

### TDD Benefits for Jarvis
- **AI Integration Confidence**: Mock AI responses for consistent testing
- **Complex Logic Validation**: Goal progress calculations, automation rules
- **API Reliability**: Comprehensive endpoint testing before UI development
- **Refactoring Safety**: Continuous improvement without breaking functionality
- **Documentation**: Tests document expected behavior for all features

### Quality Gates
Each development phase requires:
- ✅ All tests passing before moving to next feature
- ✅ Code coverage targets met per phase (80% → 85% → 90% → 95%)
- ✅ Integration tests covering critical user paths
- ✅ Performance benchmarks as executable tests

## Next Steps (TDD-First)
- **Test Infrastructure Setup**: Jest, XCTest, CI/CD pipeline
- **Technical architecture with testing strategy**
- **Database schema with test data fixtures**
- **API specification with test cases**
- **UI/UX wireframes with test scenarios**
- **TDD-driven development roadmap**
