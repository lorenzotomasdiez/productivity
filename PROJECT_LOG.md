## üéØ Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (main API) + Python + FastAPI (AI service)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with JSONB for flexible data
- **Frontend**: Native SwiftUI apps for macOS + iOS
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 + Anthropic Claude
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose on Digital Ocean droplet
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates

### TDD Decisions
- **Testing Framework**: Jest (backend) + XCTest (iOS)
- **Coverage Targets**: Progressive 80% ‚Üí 95% through development phases
- **Test Structure**: Pyramid with 70% unit tests
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing

### Security Decisions
- **Authentication**: Apple Sign In + JWT tokens
- **Token Storage**: Hashed refresh tokens in database
- **Data Security**: Row Level Security + TLS encryption
- **Privacy**: Complete user data export capability

---

## üîß Technical Fixes Applied

### Critical Security Fixes
1. **Refresh Token Hashing**: Changed from plaintext to hashed storage
2. **Database Constraints**: Added CHECK constraints for polymorphic references
3. **Environment Variables**: Removed hardcoded credentials from Docker

### Infrastructure Improvements
4. **API Consistency**: Standardized endpoint naming conventions
5. **WebSocket Auth**: Added JWT token authentication for WS connections
6. **Docker Dependencies**: Fixed service dependency order
7. **SwiftUI Version**: Updated to latest version with OS requirements

---

## üìà Metrics & Goals

### Code Quality Targets
- **Test Coverage**: 85%+ for production release
- **Security Score**: A+ rating in security audit
- **Performance**: <200ms API response times
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target

### Development Velocity
- **Week 1 (Aug 3-9)**: Planning & Architecture + TypeScript + Life Areas API + Goals API + Progress API + macOS App (‚úÖ Complete)
- **Week 2-4 (Aug 10-30)**: iOS App + Backend Integration + Core Features (‚è≥ Ready to start)  
- **Week 5-8 (Aug 31-Sep 27)**: AI Integration & Advanced Features (‚è≥ Planned)

## ü§ù Collaboration Notes

### Key Insights from Development
1. **TDD is Critical**: Complex AI integration requires extensive testing
2. **Security First**: Early security reviews prevent major refactoring
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs enable faster development
4. **Iterative Refinement**: User feedback shaped architecture decisions
5. **Native Platform Integration**: macOS-specific design patterns improve user experience

### Lessons Learned
- Address security concerns early in architecture phase
- Create realistic test data for meaningful development
- Document decisions immediately to maintain context
- Plan for AI service testing with proper mocking
- Use platform-specific design patterns (NSColor vs UIColor)
- Implement TDD for both backend and frontend components
